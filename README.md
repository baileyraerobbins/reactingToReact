# Reacting to React
## Getting Started

Create a new project with Create React App.
Delete the src directory and all of its contents.
Create a new src directory and a new index.js file inside of src.
Create a new directory named components inside of src.
You should now have a project structure that resembles the following:

node_modules/
public/
src/
|- components/
|- index.js
.gitignore
package-lock.json
package.json
README.md
Before starting the following tasks, make sure that the Chrome Developer Tools are open in your "localhost:3000" tab, and that you also have the React Developer Tools installed. You should be checking these as much as possible to not only troubleshoot these tasks, but to confirm your understanding of what you are doing. Note the React Developer tools will not activate unless they detect valid rendering React components. So if your terminal isn't running your React app with no errors, then they won't appear!
